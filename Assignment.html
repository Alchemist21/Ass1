    <h1><span>CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years - Director Demands Investigation</span></h1>

    <p> <span>LANGLEY, VA </span> — A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of
      thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
    <p>
      According to the report, sections of the documents — "almost invariably the most crucial passages" — are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read,
      due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
    </P>
    <p>
      CIA Director <span> Porter Goss </span> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the Cold War </li>
        <li> the civil-rights movement </li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
    </ul>
